# Types of Database

### Relational Database (SQL)
- Organize data into one or more tables.
- Each table has rows and columns.
- A unique key identifier for each row.

### Non Relational Database (noSQL)
- Organize data in traditional tables using other data structures.
- Key value stores (Dictionary or Hash)
- Documents (`JSON`, `XML`, `BLOB`, etc)
- `Graphs` (Relational `nodes` and `edges`)
- `mongoDB`, `dynamoDB,` `apache cassandra`, `firebase`, etc
- There is no standard language for Non Relational Database.
- Perform there own language for performing `C.R.U.D` and `administrative` operations on the database.

### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
- Help us to create and maintain a relational database.
- `MySQL`, `Oracle`, `postgreSQL`, `mariaDB`, etc.

### `SQL`
- Standardized langauge for interacting with `RDBMS`
- Used to perform `C.R.U.D` operations,as well as administrative tasks (User management, security, backup, upgrades, etc)
- Use to define database objects i.e `Schemas`, `Tables`, `Views` and `Structures`

### Database `Queries`
- Queries are requests made to the DBMS for specific information in the form of tables or views.

### `Surrogate` Key
- Surrogate key is a primary key that has no mapping to the real world.

### `Natural` Key
- Natural key is a primary key that has a mapping to the real world (Social Security Number in U.S.A for each citizens)
